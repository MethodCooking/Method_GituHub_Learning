# Method_GituHub_Learning
Learning Git and GitHub fundamentals for Method Cooking development - safe space to experiment and document progress

## Day 1 Learning Notes

### What I learned today:
- Created my first GitHub repository
- Learned the difference between Git and GitHub
- Git is like a super-powered save button that keeps every version
- GitHub is the cloud storage for my code

### Git concepts I understand:
- Repository = my complete project folder
- Commit = a saved snapshot with a message
- Push = send changes to GitHub
- GitHub has rendered view (pretty) and source view (raw code)


## EXPERIMENT 1 - Testing Branch Workflow
This content only exists in the experiment-1 branch!
If I switch back to main, this text will disappear.

### Experimental Ideas:
- Try different documentation styles
- Test new feature concepts
- Safe space to break things


## Update from GitHub
This change was made directly on GitHub's website.
